# Project 1: Customer Segmentation & Market Basket Analysis 
-  _Introduction_: The project aimed to gain insights into customer behavior and uncover growth opportunities in the online retail domain. Using R Studio, a process was followed, which included understanding t, cleaning, and transformation the dataset, leading to customer segmentation through clustering and exploration of market basket analysis.
-  _Data Preparation_: The dataset was thoroughly analyzed, and necessary cleaning steps were undertaken to handle null values, duplicates, and format date columns appropriately. Customers were distinguished based on cancellations, and new variables - Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Attributes - were calculated.
- _Techniques Used_: The primary techniques employed were clustering and market basket analysis. To support the analysis, visualization techniques like ggplot and radar charts were utilized to explore transaction patterns and cluster characteristics effectively.
- _Key Findings_: The data exploration provided deep insights into customer behavior, revealing transaction and revenue distribution, seasonal patterns, and peak activity hours. The analysis highlighted the significance of the UK market and the contribution of Germany and France to transactions and revenue.
  - _Clustering_: Clustering resulted in four distinct customer segments, each requiring specific strategies for improved engagement and loyalty.
  - _Market Basket Analysis_: The market basket analysis revealed strong product associations, suggesting opportunities for cross-selling, bundling, personalized recommendations, and targeted marketing.
- _Recommendations_: To maximize customer satisfaction and engagement, personalized strategies for each customer cluster were recommended. The retailer should focus on building customer relationships in the UK while strategically targeting Germany and France for further growth. Optimization of inventory levels, marketing campaigns, and promotions during peak periods can increase revenue. Incorporating cross-selling, bundling, and personalized recommendations will improve the customer experience and drive revenue growth. Lastly, the company should actively seek customer feedback to improve its value proposition continuously.  
- _Conclusion_: The project's findings enable data-driven decision-making and open avenues for strategic growth in the dynamic online retail landscape.
